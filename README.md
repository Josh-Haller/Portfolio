Hello, thank you for taking the time to view my Data Science portfolio! I'm excited to showcase my work and look forward to adding more projects regularly. 
My current work demonstrates my ability to clean, explore, present and analyze data using python. 
I hope this portfolio gives an overall representation of my analytical abilities and how I could contribute to your team.
Again, thank you for your time and consideration!
